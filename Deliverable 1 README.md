**This is the dataset we will be using: Hourly Electricity Consumption and Production**
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefancomanita/hourly-electricity-consumption-and-production






**Business Problem or Opportunity, Domain Knowledge:** We are trying to identify what energy means consumes the least while producing the most over time in order to invest in that energy sector. What provides the best capital expenditures in the energy sector.

**Problem:** As electricity consumption rises during peak hours, the energy grid is put under stress, which might lead to brownouts and blackouts. This has detrimental effects on public safety and healthcare institutions in addition to companies that depend on power to run.

**Opportunity:** The Romanian government is committed to reducing its carbon emissions and increasing its share of renewable energy sources. It is possible to study the data on power generation and pinpoint places where non-renewable energy sources like coal and oil/gas might be replaced with renewable energy sources like wind and solar.

**Domain knowledge:** The energy system might be less stressed and blackouts and brownouts could be avoided by understanding the patterns of power use during peak hours, identifying the industries that contribute the most to peak demand, and implementing initiatives to shift electricity usage to off-peak hours.
Romania could transition to a more sustainable energy future by understanding the current levels of production for various electricity sources, identifying the regions where wind and solar energy production could be most productive, and evaluating the economic viability of developing new renewable energy sources.


**Research Objectives:** To identify the peak and off-peak electricity consumption hours in Romania. To analyze the hourly electricity consumption and production patterns in Romania. To determine the contribution of different production types (Nuclear, Wind, Hydroelectric, Oil and Gas, Coal, Solar, Biomass) towards the total electricity production in Romania

**Descriptive Analytic Questions:** How does the hourly electricity consumption vary between weekdays and weekends? What is the average hourly electricity production by each production type in Romania? Predictive Analytic Questions: Can we predict the peak and off-peak electricity consumption hours for the next month in Romania? Can we predict the hourly electricity consumption in Romania for the next month?
